Doors Isometric
================

Technically 3d and not isometric - objects do get smaller as they get further
away.

Game world is generated by querying Kubernetes and creating a platform for each
collection and rooms with doors for each thing in a collection, ie: a platform
for a namespace is populated by rooms for each deployment and configmap, a door
to a deployment shifts you to a new platform where each room is a pod.

* Use F10 to see game stats.
* Use F12 to see system stats.
* arrow keys move player
* space key is for "jump"
* bump a door to get text info about where the door leads
* "shift" while at a door opens door and transports player to a new platform
* Jump over the invisible walls at edge of platform and game ends
* "q" quits
